# Carbon - Pebble Weather Watchface

A weather-focused, highly readable-at-a-glance Pebble watchface for the day ahead, with live weather via the free [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) API.

There are several other weather-focused Pebble watchfaces that might look similar, but I found most of those *too* maximal for my needs (forecast for more than 24 hours, too visually busy, etc.). I wanted something focused just on the things that are most relevant to me over the next 24-hour period that I can grok at a glance.

## Features

- The current time, of course, with a large, high-contrast font.
- The current date and day of week in the system locale's language.
- The current location and timezone.
- Current temperature and high/low for the day.
- 24-hour temperature graph with secondary apparent temperature line.
- 24-hour precipitation probability graph with cloud cover, plus a 24h summary of peak chance and total accumulation.
- Daylight indicator with sunrise and sunset times.
- Moon phase on the midnight indicator.
- Current weather condition icon.
- Battery level and charging status, with an optional estimated-days-remaining readout.
- Bluetooth disconnect indicator.
- Respects system 12/24-hour time format.
- Temperature unit detection based on locale (defaults to Celsius, but Fahrenheit if you're in the US).

## Display anatomy

From top to bottom, the watchface packs a 24-hour outlook above the clock and a
temperature graph below it. Every graph reads left-to-right as the **next 24
hours**, with the left edge being the current hour.

1. **Daylight line** (top) — a thin timeline of the next 24h. The solid segment
   is daytime (sunrise→sunset); short vertical ticks mark the exact sun times,
   while a sparse 3-dot dither means the time is approximate. A solid circle
   rides the line at the **noon** position, and a **moon-phase** circle at
   midnight (dark = new moon, solid = full, partially filled = crescent/gibbous
   from the lit side).
2. **Cloud cover** — little cloud puffs at each hour; bigger/denser puffs mean
   more cloud cover (nothing below ~15% = clear). On color watches, storm hours
   render grey and blizzard hours light-blue.
3. **Precipitation graph** — one vertical bar per hour, where bar height is the
   chance of precipitation. On color watches the bar color encodes the type
   (blue rain shades, grey/white snow, etc.). The bottom-right shows a 24h
   summary — **peak chance + total accumulation** (e.g. `70% 2.4mm`) — over a
   dithered backing so the bars stay visible behind it.
4. **Event strip** — warning icons over notable spans: ⚡ thunderstorm,
   ❄ heavy snow, 🌪 tornado. Empty in calm weather.
5. **Icon bar** (reserved left column, overlaid on the three graphs above) —
   three stacked slots: a **configurable** top slot (battery icon / battery % /
   date + weekday / estimated battery days / none), a **connection** slot
   (bluetooth-off or stale-weather icon), and the current **weather condition**
   icon (day or night variant).
6. **Time block** (vertically centered) — the optional city name, the large
   clock (color-customizable), flanked by the vertical timezone (left) and
   AM/PM-or-24h indicator (right), with the date below. Hiding the city and/or
   date lets the clock — and the remaining row — grow to fill the freed space.
7. **Temperature panel** (bottom) — left column shows the day's high, the large
   **current** temperature, and the low. To the right is a temperature
   **sparkline** (current + 24 hourly) with a second "feels-like" line on the
   same scale, tinted by temperature on color watches, with noon/midnight ticks
   aligned to the graphs above.

## Settings

- Temperature unit: Auto (default), Celsius, or Fahrenheit
- Date format: "Monday, 1/15" default, several other presets (please open an issue if your preferred date format isn't available)
- Accent color: color of the clock digits (white by default)
- Top-left slot: Battery icon (default), Battery %, Date + weekday, Battery days left, or None
- Show City Name: On (default) or Off — hiding it lets the clock and date grow
- Show Date: On (default) or Off — hiding it lets the clock grow
- Show Timezone: On (default) or Off
- Show AM/PM / 24h Indicator: On (default) or Off

The "Battery days left" option shows an estimate of remaining runtime — whole
days (`3d`) until under a day, then hours (`17h`). The Pebble SDK only exposes
the current charge percentage, so the estimate is derived from the observed
discharge rate and improves as it learns your usage.

## To do

- [x] Settings page for customizations
- [x] Customize date format
- [ ] Custom date format string
- [x] Customize battery indicator (e.g. show percentage instead of icon)
- [x] Customize temperature unit
- [x] Accent color for the clock digits
- [ ] Customize color scheme (e.g. light mode)
- [x] Localization (system locale)
- [ ] Custom locale support
- [ ] Bluetooth disconnect vibration
- [ ] Quiet time indicator
- [ ] Support round watches (e.g. Pebble Round 2)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Pebble SDK](https://developer.repebble.com/sdk/) (includes the `pebble` CLI tool)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (for PKJS dependencies)

### Code completion

For code completion and linting, you can use [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) with the `compile_commands.json` generated by the Waf build system. To get the most out of it, you'll want to have clangd 22+ for better docblock support. I had to install llvm via Homebrew and add it to my PATH to get a new enough version of clangd on MacOS.

### Build & run in emulator

Build the watchface using the Pebble CLI:

```sh
pebble build
```

Then install it on the emulator of your choice:

```sh
# Pebble Time 2 (rectangular, 200×228)
pebble install --emulator emery --logs

# Pebble 2 Duo (rectangular, 144×168)
pebble install --emulator flint --logs
```

Note that adding/removing `messageKeys` in package.json will require a `pebble clean` before the next build to avoid stale generated code.

#### Emulator config page

To test the config page with the emulator:

```sh
pebble emu-app-config
```

### Install on your device

If you want to be able to run the watchface on your device, you'll also want to log in with GitHub after installing the Pebble SDK:

```sh
pebble login
```

This will enable the `--cloudpebble` option:

```sh
pebble install --cloudpebble
```

### Demo Build & Screenshots

Demo builds with different weather conditions can be created with the `DEMO` environment variable. See [src/c/modules/demo.c](./src/c/modules/demo.c) for the available demo scenarios.

```sh
DEMO=1 pebble build
```

To take screenshots of a particular demo scenario you can use the Pebble CLI's screenshot command, which saves to `./screenshots`:

```sh
DEMO=1 pebble build && pebble screenshot --all-platforms
```

Note: you may need to run `pebble wipe` if the emulator stalls and try again.

### Project Structure

```
resources/      # Static assets (e.g. icon font)
scripts/        # Utility scripts (e.g. icon generation)

  c/            # C code
    generated/  # Generated C code (e.g. from generated icons)
    modules/    # C modules (settings, weather, etc.)

    main.c      # C entrypoint
  pkjs/
    index.js    # Phone-side weather & location data fetching
```

### Icons

This watchfaces uses icons from the [Carbon](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/icons/library/) icon set, which has the most exhaustive set of weather icons I could find. The name is a coincidence, I named the watchface Carbon before I found the icon set.

Icons are included as a custom font generated from [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/). The `src/embeddedjs/assets/icons.icomoon.json` file can be imported into IcoMoon to edit the icon set. When icons are added, removed, or rearranged, the font must be re-exported from IcoMoon (with font family set to "IcoMoon"), and both the TTF and the JSON selection file must be replaced.

Move the downloaded TTF font file to `resources/fonts/IcoMoon-Regular.ttf` (the `-Regular` suffix is important!) and the JSON selection file to `resources/fonts/icons.icomoon.json`, then regenerate the reference table:

```sh
npm run gen-icons
```

This will update `src/c/generated/icons.h` with the icon names and codepoints, which can be used in C code as `ICON_<NAME>` (e.g. `ICON_SUN`).
